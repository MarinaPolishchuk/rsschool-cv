**##About Me**
I am 30 years old, I worked as an accountant at the plant, graphic editor in company Mindy Support. The last place of work was the contact center of the gas service. Now I have the time and desire to finally learn JavaScript,Front-end, but it was still scary to start. My motto in life - You never know what you can do till you try.
